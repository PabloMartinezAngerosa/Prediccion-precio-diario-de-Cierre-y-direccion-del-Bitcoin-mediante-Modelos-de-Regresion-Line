# Bitcoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques


## Overview

This GitHub repository delves into the revolutionary technology introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, known as Bitcoin. Constantly evolving, Bitcoin has become a daily point of interest for investors and the technology world alike. Here, we present an investigation that compares various Machine Learning techniques, including Linear Models, Ridge Regression, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Logistic Regression. Through this comparison, we identify linear and logistic regression models as strong candidates for predicting Bitcoin prices.

## Background

Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, has reshaped financial landscapes and garnered significant attention in both investment and technology circles. The use of Machine Learning techniques to predict its price movement is a fascinating area of study.

## Usage

This repository houses code showcasing the application of Machine Learning techniques to predict Bitcoin prices. By reviewing the code, you can gain insights into the comparative analysis conducted in this research.
